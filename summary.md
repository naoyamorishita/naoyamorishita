# Summary in 150 words
Iâ€™m currently working at a geospatial consultancy company that works for Japanese Organization Development Assistance Projects.<br>
My particular interest is geographic information science application for environmental conservation with open- sourced solutions.<br>
Some of my projects have been (1) teaching GIS to forestry workers in a Pacific country, (2) researching cloud native geospatial solutions for ODA projects, and (3) analyzing deforestation and potential carbon emission for a climate mitigation framework (REDD+) application.<br>
I achieved most of the tasks with open- sourced software such as Python and QGIS.

Before joining the company, I completed M.S. in Geographic Information Science at Clark University and B.A.S. in International Development at Aoyama Gakuin University.<br>
In the graduate school, my thesis analyzed forest morphology, fragmentation and bear sightings in Massachusetts using Python and R.<br>
Moreover, I and my team worked with Wildlife Conservation Society, and I identified potential damage in the Sundarbans mangrove forest, Bangladesh.
