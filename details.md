## Introduction
- üó∫Ô∏è I am a (geo) data scientist and international development consultant.
- üêç I am interested in GIS/ remote sensing for environmental conservation with open- sourced solutions.
- üßëüèª‚Äçüíª I use Python, R, PostgreSQL, GoogleEarthEngine, a little of Julia, as well as QGIS.
- ‚úçÔ∏è I am learning Java and Scala.
- üéì I have M.S in Geographic Information Science ('24) and B.A.S in International Development ('22).
- ‚úàÔ∏è My favorite pastimes are visiting beautiful places and watching comedy show.

## Details
### Myself in 150 words
(Also visit [resume](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ijZtEYsCy4wlroVGakiaZGIpIcOqZZFoT6h-3xpDmWk/edit?usp=sharing).)

I‚Äôm a (geo) data scientist and consultant for Organization Development Assistance Projects.<br>
My particular interest lies in geographic information science for environmental conservation with open- sourced solutions.<br>
I have been (1) teaching GIS to forestry workers in a Pacific country, (2) researching cloud native geospatial solutions for ODA projects, and (3) analyzing deforestation and potential carbon emission for a climate mitigation framework (REDD+) application.<br>
I achieved most of the tasks with open- sourced software like Python and QGIS.

Before joining the company, I completed M.S. in Geographic Information Science at Clark University and B.A.S. in International Development at Aoyama Gakuin University.<br>
In my master‚Äôs thesis, I analyzed forest morphology, fragmentation and bear sightings in Massachusetts using Python and R.<br>
Moreover, we worked with Wildlife Conservation Society, and I identified potential damage in the Sundarbans mangrove forest, Bangladesh.<br>
I like visiting nature and historical places in my free time.
