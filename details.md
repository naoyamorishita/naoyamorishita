## Introduction
- üó∫Ô∏è I am a (geo) data scientist and international development consultnat.
- üêç I am interested in GIS/ remote sensing for environmental conservation with open- sourced solutions.
- üßëüèª‚Äçüíª I use Python, R, PostgreSQL, GoogleEarthEngine, a little of Julia, as well as QGIS.
- ‚úçÔ∏è I am learning Java and Scala.
- üéì I have M.S in Geographic Information Science ('24) and B.A.S in International Development ('22).
- ‚úàÔ∏è My favorite pastimes are visiting beautiful places and watching comedy show (Some photos are at [the bottom](#some-of-my-favorite-photos)).
