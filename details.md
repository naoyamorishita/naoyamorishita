# Hi there, I'm Naoya Morishita, a GIScientistüëã
## Summary
I‚Äôm currently working at a geospatial consultancy company that works for Japanese Organization Development Assistance Projects.<br>
My particular interest is geographic information science application for environmental conservation with open- sourced solutions.<br>
Some of my projects were 1) teaching GIS to forestry workers in a Pacific country, 2) researching cloud native geospatial solutions for ODA projects, and 3) analyzing deforestation and potential carbon emission for a climate mitigation framework (REDD+) application.<br>
I achieved most of the tasks with open- sourced software such as Python and QGIS.

Before joining the company, I completed M.S. in Geographic Information Science at Clark University and B.A.S. in International Development at Aoyama Gakuin University.<br>
In the graduate school, my thesis analyzed forest morphology, fragmentation and bear sightings in Massachusetts using Python and R.<br>
Moreover, I and my team worked with Wildlife Conservation Society, and I identified potential damage in mangrove forest in Sundarbans in Bangladesh.

### Industory
#### International Development Consultant (Jul 2024~)
I have been working for some GIS projects, such as **running GIS seminers in an Oceanian country for forestory application**, **preliminary analysis for REDD+ application**, and **research on cloud native GIS utilization.**

#### Other part- time jobs 
- When I was an undergraduate student, I was **a teacher of a supplementary school** in Yokohama, teaching Japanese history, English, and Japanese to elementary ~ high school students.
- Also when I was an undergraduate student, I was **working for a computer shop** to teach computer skills to and fix technical problems from customers.

### Education
#### Master of Science in Geographic Information Science (~May 2024)
*[Geographic Information Science, M.S., Clark University](https://www.clarku.edu/programs/masters/geographic-information-science-ms/) (GPA of 3.98)*

I learned fundamental~ advanced **GIS and remote sensing and how they can be incorporated into conservation projects**.<br> 
I wrote **thesis about forest morphology and fragmentation in comparison with American black bears' homerange** which I presented at conferences (See [Projects](projects--conference-poster)).

##### Leadership Experiences
*Teaching Assistant in Japanese Language Class*

I led discussion sessions where students were able to learn how to communicate in Japanese.

#### Bachelor of Arts and Sciences, major in International Development and Business (~Mar 2022)
*[School of Global Studies and Collaboration, Aoyama Gakuin University](https://www.aoyama.ac.jp/en/academic/undergraduate/gsc/)*

I learned theoretical backgrounds about **international development, industory, and Southeast Asian studies**.<br> 
I also experienced **a 5- month exchange program at [Thammasat University](https://tu.ac.th/en), Bangkok** where I deepened my understanding about the country from lecturers, students, and residents.<br> 
I then conducted **a field research about renewable energy feasibility and perception of the students.**

##### Leadership Experiences
*[AIESEC](https://aiesec.org) in Aoyama Gakuin University*

I joined the organization to help students experience international volunteering and internship.<br> 
I also **taught environmental issuses at a kindergarten in the Philippines for 6 weeks.** as a volunteering participant.<br>
In 2020, I was one of the executive board of the local committee, but due to the COVID19, we had to cancell all exchange projects.<br>
**We organized lots of events, such as online international dialogues to maintain the organization and its philosophy even under such catastorophe.**
